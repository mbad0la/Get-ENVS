Vagrantfiles for various development environments.

### Why?
**Straight from the [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) Docs,**  
_Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team._
This is so like a boon for people who are unaware of or find it cumbersome to setup reliable development environments that do not interfere with one other.  
Say goodbye to "works on my machine" bugs!
